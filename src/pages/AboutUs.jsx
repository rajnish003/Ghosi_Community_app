        The Ghosi community is a well-known community in the state of Uttar Pradesh and is present in every district of the state.
        This community is scattered all over India and lives in almost every state. In Delhi, the Ghosi live in the heart of the city,
        particularly along the border between Old Delhi and New Delhi. In Rajasthan, the Ghosi are found in the Pink City (Jaipur) as well
        as in Jhunjhunu, Jodhpur, Kota, and Sikar areas. In some parts of Rajasthan, they are also known as Gujjar Ghosi.

        This community is not only found in India but also in some parts of Pakistan. The Ghosi community mostly resides in urban areas or towns. 
        They have been associated with cattle rearing for ages, extracting milk and selling it in markets or to households. They also sell milk-related 
        products like ghee and khoya. Apart from this occupation, they are majorly linked with agriculture. This involvement in agriculture supports 
        their cattle with fodder and allows them to grow vegetables and products for self-consumption.
